# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** You ask Claude something about your city, it sees the current screenshot and live stats, and responds with narrative commentary that remembers where the city has been — in a polished chat panel that feels like it belongs in the game.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — API Migration & Core Stability

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Claude API as primary (not Ollama): Ollama format was scaffolding; full migration needed before anything else works
- No streaming API: Coherent GT binding layer not designed for incremental updates — use `stream: false` with loading indicator
- Brave Search over Bing: Free tier (2,000/month), single header auth, fits existing async HTTP pattern

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 1]: `ClaudeAPISystem` currently sends Ollama `/api/chat` format — all tool calls, screenshots, and the tool loop are broken until migration is complete
- [Pre-Phase 1]: `CityToolRegistry.GetToolsJson()` is dead code (called nowhere) — must audit against Anthropic spec before enabling
- [Pre-Phase 1]: ECS component names for budget/traffic are unconfirmed — runtime discovery needed before Phase 3 can begin
- [Pre-Phase 1]: `NarrativeMemorySystem` public API surface is partially inferred — needs direct code read before Phase 5 begins
